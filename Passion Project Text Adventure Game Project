 GAME DESCRIPTION

Dive into the spinning fun with our IPython Notebook-based "Wheel of Fortune" game! Across three thrilling rounds, players take turns to spin the digital wheel, guessing letters to reveal hidden words. With each correct guess, underscores flip to unveil letters, edging you closer to victory. Strategize and solve diverse puzzles, banking virtual cash as you uncover each word. Whether you're a wordsmith or a casual player, this game promises to challenge your vocabulary and puzzle-solving skills. Get ready to spin, guess, and win in this engaging and interactive word game experience!
